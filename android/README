== SETUP ==
   You must first install the android linux sdk (Not the ADT, unless you want eclipse also). Google for it.

   sudo apt-get install ia32-libs

   Launch android and update all the packages. Edit your bashrc to include the line:
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/android-sdk-linux/tools/:$HOME/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools/

   Then, run "updateproject.sh" to generate the build files.

== RUNNING/BUILDING ==
   (Make sure you have an android device plugged in)

   Open two terminals. In the first:
     $ ./followlog.sh

   In the second:
     $ ant debug
     $ ./installrun.sh


== TROUBLESHOOTING ==
If you get an error like:
   Failure [INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_INCONSISTENT_CERTIFICATES]

The reason is that the device already has the app installed from a
different machine. You can uninstall the app by going to Setting s and
uninstalling.
